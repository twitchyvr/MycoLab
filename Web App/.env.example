# Sporely Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# For Netlify: Add these in Site Settings > Environment Variables

# Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED for authentication and cloud sync)
# Get these from your Supabase project: Settings > API
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Alternative name for anon key (either works)
# VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Cloudflare Turnstile Configuration (OPTIONAL - for captcha protection)
# Leave unset to use test keys (recommended for non-Cloudflare deployments)
# VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY=your-turnstile-site-key
#
# IMPORTANT: Turnstile requires matching configuration:
# - If NOT deploying behind Cloudflare (e.g., Netlify, Vercel):
#   1. Do NOT set VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY (the app will use test keys)
#   2. In Supabase Dashboard: Auth > Captcha Protection, use test secret key:
#      1x0000000000000000000000000000000AA
#
# - If deploying behind Cloudflare (Cloudflare Pages, or CF in front of site):
#   1. Set VITE_TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY to your real site key
#   2. In Supabase Dashboard: Auth > Captcha Protection, use your real secret key

# IMPORTANT:
# 1. Variable names MUST start with VITE_ for Vite to expose them to the app
# 2. For Netlify deployments, set these in the Netlify Dashboard:
#    Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment > Environment Variables
# 3. After adding/changing env vars, you MUST trigger a new build
#    (make a commit or use "Trigger deploy" in Netlify)
# 4. The values are embedded at BUILD TIME, not runtime
