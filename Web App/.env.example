# MycoLab Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
# For Netlify: Add these in Site Settings > Environment Variables

# Supabase Configuration (REQUIRED for authentication and cloud sync)
# Get these from your Supabase project: Settings > API
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# Alternative name for anon key (either works)
# VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_DEFAULT_KEY=your-anon-key-here

# IMPORTANT:
# 1. Variable names MUST start with VITE_ for Vite to expose them to the app
# 2. For Netlify deployments, set these in the Netlify Dashboard:
#    Site Settings > Build & Deploy > Environment > Environment Variables
# 3. After adding/changing env vars, you MUST trigger a new build
#    (make a commit or use "Trigger deploy" in Netlify)
# 4. The values are embedded at BUILD TIME, not runtime
